    "- Foursquare contains more unique POIs (Point of Interest names) than Yelp.\n",
    "- Yelp provides ratings, while Foursquare does not.\n",
    "- Yelp provides review counts, while Foursquare does not.\n",
    "- Foursquare has more unique addresses, suggesting a larger variety of exact POI locations.\n",
    "- Yelp includes postal codes separately, while Foursquare includes it in the formatted address. I specifically called the complete address from Foursquare. [Here's where we fixed it.](../data/cleaning.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Differences:\n",
    "1. Data Richness\n",
    "  - Yelp provides more detailed metadata for each POI, including poi_rating and poi_review_count, which are absent or incomplete in Foursquare.\n",
    "  - Foursquare, however, captures more unique POIs and geographical diversity (poi_latitude, poi_longitude, and poi_address).\n",
    "2. Distance Data\n",
    "  - Yelp has significantly more unique distance_from_station values compared to Foursquare (9,523 vs. 986). This could indicate that Yelp uses more precise or dynamic calculations for distances\n",
    "3. POI Identification\n",
    "  - Foursquare has more unique poi_name entries (586 vs. 485), suggesting broader POI coverage or naming diversity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Considerations for Use:\n",
    "\n",
    "**I. Coverage**\n",
    "\n",
    "If the goal is to analyze broader POI coverage with less focus on reviews, Foursquare might be more suitable.\n",
    "\n",
    "For richer metadata and finer granularity, Yelp is better.\n",
    "\n",
    "**II. Data Completeness**\n",
    "\n",
    "Yelp offers ratings and review counts, which can be useful for analyzing popularity or quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Foursquare’s broader geographic and POI coverage could be valuable for location-specific analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**III. Integration**\n",
    "\n",
    "Matching datasets may require careful handling of poi_name and poi_address, as Foursquare has more unique values, potentially with more variations.\n"
